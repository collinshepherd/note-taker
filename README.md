## Description

This project was created so you can keep track of all your notes in one simple and easy place. The user can add and delete notes as they choose to do so. You can also click on the title of your note to see the text inside of it. I was able to learn a lot about using Express to run an application with a database and it was awesome to see the page update itself without needing to refresh the page.
