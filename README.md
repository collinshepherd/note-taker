## Description

This project was created so you can keep track of all your notes in one simple and easy place. The user can add and delete notes as they choose to do so. You can also click on the title of your note to see the text inside of it. I was able to learn a lot about using Express to run an application with a database and it was awesome to see the page update itself without needing to refresh the page.

You can click inside the Note Title and Note Text to add your own note to the list. You can also click the trash can icon on your note to delete it. To see the text inside your note click on the title of the note of the left side and your note will be shown on the right.
